        <h1>You can write out your thoughts here</h1>
        <h2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h2>
        <h3>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h3>
        <h4>I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>
        <h5>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>

                This div contains this text and the div tag below.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I 
                    contain this text and two other children divs
                </p>

                    <p>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make
                        sure you indent this example appropriately.

        <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
        <p>Here is what I like about lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>That's about it</li>
            <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
            <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ol>
            <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
        </ol>
